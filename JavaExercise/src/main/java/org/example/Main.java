        /*Day 1 questions:
        Q:1. What is Java programming language and what are its key features?
        A: Java is one of the most popular Object oriented programming languages in the world. One of its key features is that the java programs can be executed on different platforms and operating systems(WORA- Write once run anywhere).

        2. Explain the process of setting up the Java development environment, including the installation of JDK and an IDE.
        It's a simple process for which can be used official vendors of IDE, e.g. JetBrains.
        3. What is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and what is its role in executing Java programs?
        Java Virtual machine is an abstract machine. It is a runtime environment that executes bytecode files(.class)
        Implementation of JVM depends on the hardware which wll be executed on. This gives the possibility to execute the same program on different everywhere.
        JVM is part of JRE which is part of JDK.
        4. Describe the steps involved in compiling and running a Java program using the command line.
        When we compile .java files, .class files are generated. They are bytecode files.
        Then JVM loading .class files using Class Loader.
        Then JVM verifies all the code and execute it.
        5. How does Java handle memory management and what is the significance of the garbage collector?
        Java automatically manages the memory with the help of the garbage collector.
        JVM defines different memory areas:
        -Heap Area
        -Method Area
        -JVM Stacks
        -Native Method Stacks
        -Program Counter (PC) Registers
        Garbage collector runs in background and clear the memory from objects that are no longer used.
        6. Compare and contrast Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA as Java IDEs, highlighting their key features and differences.
        7. What are the basic data types available in Java, and how are they used in variable declarations and assignments?
        Basic data types are also called data primitives:
        int, short, long, float, double, boolean, char
        They can be used in declaration of variable as follows:
        int number = 1;


        Day 2 questions:
        1. What is the basic structure of a Java program? Describe the roles of classes, methods, and statements.
        Basically we can say that everything in java is classes.
        Simple program is made by class and main method.
        2. What are the primitive data types in Java? Give examples of each.
        3. How do you declare and initialize a variable in Java?
        Provide an example for each of the following data types: int, double, boolean, and String.
        4. What is the scope of a variable in Java? Explain the concepts of local variables, instance variables, and class variables.
        5. What is the difference between the "==" operator and the "equals" method when comparing two objects in Java?
        6. Explain the concept of type casting in Java. How can you convert a variable from one data type to another?
        7. What is the difference between static and non-static methods in Java? How do you call each of these methods?
