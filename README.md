## Introduction

Design patterns are standardized solutions to common problems in software design, helping developers write code that is robust, flexible, and easier to maintain. This repository provides a hands-on guide to various design patterns implemented in Java. Each pattern includes:

- A brief description of its purpose.
- A UML diagram illustrating its structure.
- A practical Java example demonstrating its implementation.

## Design Patterns Covered

The guide covers design patterns in three main categories:

### Creational Patterns

These patterns simplify object creation, enhancing flexibility and reusability.

| Pattern              | Description                                                           | Status |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Singleton**        | Ensures only one instance of a class exists.                          | ✅     |
| **Factory Method**   | Provides an interface for creating instances of related classes.      | ✅     |
| **Abstract Factory** | Creates families of related objects without specifying exact classes. | ✅     |
| **Builder**          | Builds complex objects step-by-step.                                  | 🟡     |
| **Prototype**        | Creates new objects by copying an existing instance.                  | 🟡     |

### Structural Patterns

These patterns deal with object composition, helping to create large structures with improved relationships.

| Pattern       | Description                                                     | Status |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Adapter**   | Enables incompatible interfaces to work together.               | 🟡     |
| **Bridge**    | Decouples abstraction from implementation.                      | 🟡     |
| **Composite** | Represents part-whole hierarchies with tree structures.         | 🟡     |
| **Decorator** | Adds functionality to objects dynamically.                      | 🟡     |
| **Facade**    | Simplifies complex system interactions with a single interface. | 🟡     |
| **Flyweight** | Shares data to minimize memory use.                             | 🟡     |
| **Proxy**     | Controls access to an object, providing a placeholder.          | 🟡     |

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns manage object interactions and communication, making systems flexible and responsive.

| Pattern                     | Description                                            | Status |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Passes requests along a chain of handlers.             | 🟡     |
| **Command**                 | Encapsulates requests as objects.                      | 🟡     |
| **Interpreter**             | Provides a way to interpret custom language grammars.  | 🟡     |
| **Iterator**                | Sequentially accesses elements of a collection.        | 🟡     |
| **Mediator**                | Simplifies complex object communication.               | 🟡     |
| **Memento**                 | Captures and restores an object's state.               | 🟡     |
| **Observer**                | Notifies dependent objects of state changes.           | 🟡     |
| **State**                   | Alters object behavior based on its internal state.    | 🟡     |
| **Strategy**                | Allows for interchangeable algorithms in an operation. | 🟡     |
| **Template Method**         | Defines steps of an algorithm, allowing customization. | 🟡     |
| **Visitor**                 | Adds operations to classes without modifying them.     | 🟡     |
