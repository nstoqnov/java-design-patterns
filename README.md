## Introduction

Design patterns are standardized solutions to common problems in software design, helping developers write code that is robust, flexible, and easier to maintain. This repository provides a hands-on guide to various design patterns implemented in Java. Each pattern includes:
- A brief description of its purpose.
- A UML diagram illustrating its structure.
- A practical Java example demonstrating its implementation.

## Design Patterns Covered

The guide covers design patterns in three main categories:

### Creational Patterns

These patterns simplify object creation, enhancing flexibility and reusability.

| Pattern            | Description                                                   | Status  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Singleton**      | Ensures only one instance of a class exists.                  | ✅ |
| **Factory Method** | Provides an interface for creating instances of related classes. | ✅  |
| **Abstract Factory** | Creates families of related objects without specifying exact classes. | ✅  |
| **Builder**        | Builds complex objects step-by-step.                          | 🟡  |
| **Prototype**      | Creates new objects by copying an existing instance.          | 🟡   |

### Structural Patterns

These patterns deal with object composition, helping to create large structures with improved relationships.

| Pattern          | Description                                                   | Status  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Adapter**      | Enables incompatible interfaces to work together.             | ❌ Not Started |
| **Bridge**       | Decouples abstraction from implementation.                    | ❌ Not Started         |
| **Composite**    | Represents part-whole hierarchies with tree structures.       | ❌ Not Started         |
| **Decorator**    | Adds functionality to objects dynamically.                    | ❌ Not Started         |
| **Facade**       | Simplifies complex system interactions with a single interface. | ❌ Not Started       |
| **Flyweight**    | Shares data to minimize memory use.                           | ❌ Not Started         |
| **Proxy**        | Controls access to an object, providing a placeholder.        | ❌ Not Started         |

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns manage object interactions and communication, making systems flexible and responsive.

| Pattern                | Description                                                   | Status  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Passes requests along a chain of handlers.            | ❌ Not Started         |
| **Command**            | Encapsulates requests as objects.                             | ❌ Not Started         |
| **Interpreter**        | Provides a way to interpret custom language grammars.        | ❌ Not Started         |
| **Iterator**           | Sequentially accesses elements of a collection.              | ❌ Not Started         |
| **Mediator**           | Simplifies complex object communication.                     | ❌ Not Started         |
| **Memento**            | Captures and restores an object's state.                     | ❌ Not Started         |
| **Observer**           | Notifies dependent objects of state changes.                 | ❌ Not Started         |
| **State**              | Alters object behavior based on its internal state.          | ❌ Not Started         |
| **Strategy**           | Allows for interchangeable algorithms in an operation.       | ❌ Not Started         |
| **Template Method**    | Defines steps of an algorithm, allowing customization.        | ❌ Not Started         |
| **Visitor**            | Adds operations to classes without modifying them.           | ❌ Not Started         |
