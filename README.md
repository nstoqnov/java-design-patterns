## Introduction

Design patterns are standardized solutions to common problems in software design, helping developers write code that is robust, flexible, and easier to maintain. This repository provides a hands-on guide to various design patterns implemented in Java. Each pattern includes:
- A brief description of its purpose.
- A UML diagram illustrating its structure.
- A practical Java example demonstrating its implementation.

## Design Patterns Covered

The guide covers design patterns in three main categories:

### Creational Patterns

These patterns simplify object creation, enhancing flexibility and reusability.

| Pattern          | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Singleton**    | Ensures only one instance of a class exists.                  |
| **Factory Method** | Provides an interface for creating instances of related classes. |
| **Abstract Factory** | Creates families of related objects without specifying exact classes. |
| **Builder**      | Builds complex objects step-by-step.                          |
| **Prototype**    | Creates new objects by copying an existing instance.          |

### Structural Patterns

These patterns deal with object composition, helping to create large structures with improved relationships.

| Pattern          | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adapter**      | Enables incompatible interfaces to work together.             |
| **Bridge**       | Decouples abstraction from implementation.                    |
| **Composite**    | Represents part-whole hierarchies with tree structures.       |
| **Decorator**    | Adds functionality to objects dynamically.                    |
| **Facade**       | Simplifies complex system interactions with a single interface. |
| **Flyweight**    | Shares data to minimize memory use.                           |
| **Proxy**        | Controls access to an object, providing a placeholder.        |

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns manage object interactions and communication, making systems flexible and responsive.

| Pattern          | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Passes requests along a chain of handlers.       |
| **Command**      | Encapsulates requests as objects.                             |
| **Interpreter**  | Provides a way to interpret custom language grammars.        |
| **Iterator**     | Sequentially accesses elements of a collection.              |
| **Mediator**     | Simplifies complex object communication.                     |
| **Memento**      | Captures and restores an object's state.                     |
| **Observer**     | Notifies dependent objects of state changes.                 |
| **State**        | Alters object behavior based on its internal state.          |
| **Strategy**     | Allows for interchangeable algorithms in an operation.       |
| **Template Method** | Defines steps of an algorithm, allowing customization.   |
| **Visitor**      | Adds operations to classes without modifying them.           |
